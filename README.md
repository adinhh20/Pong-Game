# Pong-Game

My first attempt to re-create the classic Pong game for 2 players.

Directions:
- 1st Player: Use "W" key to move up and "S" key to move down.
- 2nd Player: Use the up arrow key to move up and down arrow key to move down.

Next Goals:
- Fix the sound error (somehow the sounds don't work)
- Clean up the code for a more object-oriented design.
- Add levels: harder level with different speeds, etc.
- Make two options: 1 vs 1 (original) and 1 Bot.
